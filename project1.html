        <p id="first">Red river hogs are very majestic animals, perhaps the most majestic of the hog family.They are covered in reddish hair, with tufts of cream colored hair sprounitng from the tail, ears, and like a mane around the head. They do have a patch of black hair surrounfint their eyes. Overall, they are very cute.</p>
        <p>I had the amazing oppurtunity to see a red river hog at the binder park zoo. It was a life changing expirience that ultimately complelled me to buy a red river hog stuffed anaimal from the gift shop.</p>
